## Task 5 - Linux User Expiry

#### A developer named rose has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for rose. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

#### Therefore, create a user named rose on the App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Set expiry date to 2021-04-15. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

Once connected to the server, we will use the useradd command preceded by sudo, requires privileges, and use the -e option to indicate that we want the account to expire on a given date.

```bash
$ sudo useradd -e 2021-04-15 rose
```

![sudo useradd command](/img/LINUX/LinuxL01/Task05_02_sudo_useradd.png)

Now let's verify that the account has been set to expire on the specified date. To do this we will use the chage command. This command is used to modify a user's password expiration data. We will use the -l option to list the user's password information.

```bash
$ sudo chage -l rose
```

![sudo chage](/img/LINUX/LinuxL01/Task05_03_sudo_chage.png)

As we can see in the "Account expieres" section, the date coincides with the value given above.
